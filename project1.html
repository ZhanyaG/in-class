            Description of the object: 'A size 8 ring encased in fake gold and shiny enough to be seen from 50 feet away, It was Gold and had eldritch writing from the Lord of rings movies, it was a gift from my oldest brother when i was around 16. The ring that rules over them all, the writing was in a darker toned yellow but still very small and hidden.'
