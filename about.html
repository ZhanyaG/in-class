        <p style="text-align: center;"> About me: I am an undergraduate student at Parsons School of Design in NYC, majoring in Design and Technology and minoring in Fashion Business and Immersive Storytelling. </p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"> My interests: I love reading classic books, dancing contemporary, going to pilates, and hanging around Manhattan. </p>
        
            <p style="text-align: center;"> Career goals: I am interested in integrating future technologies into art and daily life. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Reflections: My journey with technology began in high school when I studied IT in Global Society. Initially intimidated by coding, I have now embraced it in my 20s and enjoy building my skills.</p>
