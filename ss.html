            My design is connected to patterns on a chipboard, by graving the ornaments of Kazakh culture. I was really interested in doing an art that connects Kazakh traditional dishes or accessories, like yuvelir. It’s also really popular among the culture to wear wood accessories. As the main focus of the project is to embrace cultural identity, I want to promote and popularize my community to a bigger scale, as Central Asia is a still secret gem for everyone who is abroad. My work was also published in Parsons Notes:
